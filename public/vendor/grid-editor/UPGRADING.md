Upgrading from grid-editor `0.*` to `1.*`
=========================================

Grid-editor `0.*` is for bootstrap __3__, `1.*` for bootstrap __4__.
Since the breakpoints for the gridsystem have changed from 3 to 4, all the HTML that was generated using grid-editor `0.*` must be adjusted.
Change all the classes in the HTML from `col-md` to `col-lg`. No other changes to the HTML are needed.
